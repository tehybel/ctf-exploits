# CTF exploits

This repository contains some of my solutions to old pwning CTF problems.

These exploits won't make much sense unless you've already worked on the
problem yourself. They are provided so that people practicing can see
alternative ways to solve the problems. As CTFs happen under time pressure,
expect low-quality (but working!) code.
